# My CV in SAPUI5

this is a simple project to have a CV in SAPUI5 on github that is accessible directly with github pages.

## Installation

clone this repo in your repo.

Activate github pages.

Adapt the english-cv and french-cv with your cv :)

change the configuration of your repo github pages to look at docs folder (instead of root).

To deploy any changes to the CV, you will need to run "npm run deploy" command. Before doing it, delete the docs folder, it will be regenerated by the build. You can then push your changes.


## License
